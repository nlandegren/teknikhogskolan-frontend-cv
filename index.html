                <p>I am currently enrolled in a program in .NET-development at the vocational university Teknikhögskolan, which I take remotely from my home in Stockholm. I have previously graduated from Stockholm University with a Bachelor’s degree in linguistics specialized in computational linguistics. My main interests lie in programming and writing. In the future I want to keep writing both code, and prose, to deepen my knowledge in programming as well as in literature.</p>
